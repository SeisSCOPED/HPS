ðŸ“– On this JupyterBook website, you will find resources for high-performance computing tailored to seismological research. In particular, we talk about two types of large-scale seismological research:
* Wavefield and earthquake simulations
* Big Data Mining

Both leverage two computing architectures: HPC and Cloud. This book provides training for best practices in computing andf software environment.

 <!-- you'll find [tutorials](tutorials/index). All tutorials are Jupyter Notebooks, designed to be run interactively, but also rendered on this website for convenience. -->
