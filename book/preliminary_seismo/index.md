# Preliminary Seismology

The workshop will dive into advanced computing levels starting the second day. We recommend to seismologists to assess their level of comfort in computing in seismological research. We selected several beginner and intermediate tutorials that have been fantastic to get refreshers on computing skills for seismic data and that we recommend.

```{attention}
Please make sure to find some time to go through the below material before
the workshop.
```

## Basic Seismology
- Please watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFwdjfiK4gk) of an introduction to Opbsy.
- Install Obspy using conda: ```conda install -c conda-forge obspy```
- [Reading seismograms](https://docs.obspy.org/tutorial/code_snippets/reading_seismograms.html)
- [Plot waveforms](https://docs.obspy.org/tutorial/code_snippets/waveform_plotting_tutorial.html)
- [Filter data](https://docs.obspy.org/tutorial/code_snippets/filtering_seismograms.html)
- [Spectrograms](https://docs.obspy.org/tutorial/code_snippets/plotting_spectrograms.html)
- [Focal mechanism](https://www.ocean.washington.edu/courses/oc410/reading/Focal_mechanism_primer.pdf)

## Intermediate Seismology
- [Practice downloading and plotting](https://krischer.github.io/seismo_live_build/html/ObsPy/07_Basic_Processing_Exercise_solution_wrapper.html)
