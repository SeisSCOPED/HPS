# Preparation Necessary for the workshop



We ask the participants to come with the following required steps:


## **Docker**

Users will need to install Docker software on their laptop. To install the Docker software, go to the Docker website, and create a Docker account. The free “personal” version of Docker desktop can be used.

One you are logged into the Docker website, navigate to the “Downloads” page and select the Docker Desktop version (Mac, Windows, Linux) that matches the operating systems on your laptop.

The Docker Desktop installation process varies between operating systems. Please contact the workshop’s technical support people on the workshop Slack channel for help if you have problems installing the Docker Desktop software on your system.

In some cases, you may need System Administration privileges to install Docker.
