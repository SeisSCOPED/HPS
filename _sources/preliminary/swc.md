# Software Carpentry Training

[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) is a fantastic organization that teaches basic lab skills for research computing.

If you are new to Git, Linux, Python, please set aside a day or two to go over these materials in advance.

## Getting ready

Please take a minute before the workshop to go over the [GitHub instructions](github),
create an account.

```{attention}
We will be using the JupyterHub ({{ jupyterhub_url }}) throughout this workshop.
We encourage you to test your [connection to JupyterHub](jupyterhub) before the training.
```
