## Considerations

This workshop targets the seismologists who want to learn new tools to process and model at large scale seismological research. The participants will work with Docker, GitHub, Python, Shell on laptops, HPC, and Cloud systems.


## Selection Criteria

Participants will be selected based on:
* Their availability and commitment to attend the week of the workshop (the training will be made available online later for everyone interested)
* Their interest in seismological research or expertise in using CyberInfrastructure (HPC + Big Data)
* Space limitations (computing allocations limited to 20 participants per platform)

We seek a broad representation across levels and demography,
