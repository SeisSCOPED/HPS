# Application

We are glad you are interested in applying to participate in {{hackweek}}! 

Application is closed.

## Considerations

We welcome people from a diverse range of career stages, experience levels, backgrounds and identities. Our goals are:
* To lower the entry barriers to high-performance computing of theoretical and observational seismology,
* To foster a community of practice around these topics,
* To promote Open-Science and best software and data practice in seismological research.


## Selection Criteria

Participants will be selected based on:
Their availability and commitment to attend the week of the workshop (the training will be made available online later for everyone interested)
Their interest in seismological research or expertise in using CyberInfrastructure (HPC + Big Data)
Space limitations (computing allocations limited to 20 participants per platform)

We seek a broad representation across levels and demography
